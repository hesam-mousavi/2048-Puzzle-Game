# n×n 2048 Puzzle Game
2048 is an easy and fun puzzle game.<br>
Even if you don't love numbers you will love this game.<br>
It is played on a 3x3 grid or **higher** (*for ex: 8x8, default is 4x4*) using the ↑ → ↓ ← arrows or W, A, S, D keys alternatively.<br>
Every time you press a key - all tiles slide.<br>
Tiles with the same value that bump into one-another are merged.<br>
Although there might be an optimal strategy to play, there is always some level of chance.<br>
